ChatTime is an open source [(licensed under MPL)](LICENSE) chat server and client written in Kotlin.

## Libraries and other sources

ChatTime uses these nice libraries:
- [picocli](https://github.com/remkop/picocli) for command-line parsing
- [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) and [RxKotlin](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxKotlin) for event handling
- [TornadoFX](https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx) for the new JavaFX GUI client

The WIP JavaFX-based client, Winter, uses icons from [Icons8](https://icons8.com).
